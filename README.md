# Assistance Programs Enrollment Gap Data Tool

## 1 Introduction

The City of Philadelphia has introduced several progressive assistance programs to help residents manage rising Real Estate Tax bills, driven by the city's increasing home values. These programs are specifically designed to support low-income households, senior citizens, and other vulnerable communities.   

The various assistance programs:  
•	Homestead Exemption  
•	Owner-occupied Real Estate Tax Payment Agreement (OOPA)  
•	Longtime Owner Occupants Program (LOOP)  
•	Senior Tax Freeze  
•	Low Income Tax Freeze  
•	Ten Year Tax Abatement  

### 1.1 Scope

We developed a data tool that uses internal geospatial data on current enrollment in two assistance programs for homeowner-occupied residential properties - **Homestead Exemption and LOOP** - compared against the number of owner-occupied houses in each census tract, as provided by the American Community Survey (ACS) published by the Census Bureau. See [Methodology]() for more details.

This map helps identify areas of low enrollment to target outreach along with the [Racial Equity Outreach Map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/43775b96f14848e5acc258b344921efa) and to track overtime enrollment. 

## 2 Enrollment Gap

Enrollment gap is the number of owner occupied residences (estimate from ACS 5 year estimates from 2022) that are not enrolled in either Homestead or LOOP (internal Department of Revenue data)

The above map shows the enrollment gap across census tracts in Philadelphia. Darker shade indicates relativerly higher enrollment gap. 

Most of the enrollment gap is are concentrated in the northeastern part of the city, with a few census tracts in the center and southwest also showing relatively high gaps. Grayed-out tracts indicate areas with insufficient data.
