# Outreach Data Tool

This data tool uses internal geospatial data on current enrollment in two assistance programs for homeowner-occupied residential properties - **Homestead Exemption and LOOP** - and compares it against the number of owner-occupied houses in each census tract, provided by the American Community Survey (ACS) published by the Census Bureau. 

## Enrollment Gap - Census Tracts
Below maps visualize total enrollment gap in absolute and percent terms to identify census tracts that need more attention for outreach.

**Calculation**  

>**Absolute Enrollment Gap** = Total Number of Owner Occupied Residences in a Census Tract - Total Enrollment in Homestead and LOOP in each Census Tract

>**Enrollment Gap in Percent** = (Absolute Enrollment for each Census Tract / Total Number of Owner Occupied Residences in a Census Tract) * 100
